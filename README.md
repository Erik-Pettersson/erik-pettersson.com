# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, [erik-pettersson.com](https://erik-pettersson.com).

## About
I made this website as a digital business card with links to my social profiles and contact information. It is my first portfolio project and will be updated to showcase my future work.

My primary goal was to build a lightweight, visually appealing, and responsive single-page site using only fundamental web technologies.

## Tech
- **Code:** Vanilla HTML5 & CSS3
- **Hosting:** Deployed with GitHub Pages
- **Domain & Services:** DNS and domain management via Cloudflare
